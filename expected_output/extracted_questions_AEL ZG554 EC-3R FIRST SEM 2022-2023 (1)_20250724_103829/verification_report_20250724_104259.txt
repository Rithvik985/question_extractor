======================================================================

File: question_01_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q1, which asks to implement a 3-bit incrementer using the FPGA CLB block, with specific input and output requirements. There are no sub-questions, sets, or variations of this question present in the given content.
Text Length: 446 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_02_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q2) with multiple sub-questions (a, b, c, d), but no separate sets are identified, so it is counted as one distinct main question.
Text Length: 1395 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_03_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q3) with two sub-questions (a and b), but they are part of the same main question and there are no separate sets (e.g. SET A, SET B).
Text Length: 961 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_04_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q4) with multiple Boolean functions to be implemented using a Programmable Array Logic (PAL), and the task is to compute the worst-case delay required to compute all four functions. There are no sub-questions or sets, just a single question with multiple parts to be considered in the solution.
Text Length: 405 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_05_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q5) with sub-questions (a and b), but no separate sets are identified, so it is counted as one distinct main question.
Text Length: 483 chars
Action: Keep as is
