======================================================================

File: question_01_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q1, which asks to design a network collision detector using FPGA, with a specific implementation requirement. There are no sub-questions, sets, or variants of this question present in the given content.
Text Length: 631 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_02_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q2, which asks to compute the minimum number of LUTs and MUXs required to implement a seven input arbitrary function, with additional sub-questions to re-compute and generalize the expression. There are no sets or multiple variants of the question.
Text Length: 405 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_03_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1

Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_04_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q4) with a specific scenario and asks about the logic function implemented by the circuit and the effect of a single event upset (SEU) error on the output. There are no distinct sets or sub-questions that would increase the question count.
Text Length: 385 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_05_multipage.pdf
