======================================================================

File: question_01_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q1, with a specific problem to be solved using lookup tables (LUTs) and a truth table approach. There are no indications of multiple sets or sub-questions that would increase the question count.
Text Length: 402 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_02_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q2) with sub-questions (a and b), but no separate sets are identified, so it is counted as one distinct main question.
Text Length: 421 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_03_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q3, which asks the designer to implement a 6-bit comparator using the carry logic of XC4000 and provide a circuit diagram of the logic implemented by the LUTs. There are no sub-questions or sets mentioned.
Text Length: 330 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_04_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, Q4, which asks to show how a simplified block diagram of the XC4000 CLB can be used to build a 8x1 dual-port RAM. There are no sub-questions, sets, or other question variants.
Text Length: 280 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_05_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 3
Reason: The content contains actual questions (Q5 with sub-questions a, b, and c), and there are no sets (e.g., SET A, SET B) mentioned, so each sub-question under Q5 is considered part of the main question, resulting in a total of 3 distinct main questions (a, b, and c under Q5).
