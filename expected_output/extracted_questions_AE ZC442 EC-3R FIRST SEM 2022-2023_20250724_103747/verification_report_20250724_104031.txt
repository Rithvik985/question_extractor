File: question_01_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Q.1 Set. (A) Compare the Laplacian kernel...", with a specific task and matrix provided, indicating a distinct question. There is no indication of multiple sets or sub-questions that would increase the question count.
Text Length: 309 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_02_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q.1 Set) with a specific task to compare the Laplacian kernel, which indicates the presence of an actual question. There is no indication of multiple sets (e.g., SET A, SET B) or sub-questions, so the question count remains 1.
Text Length: 311 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_03_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Q.2 Set. (A)", which includes a specific problem to be solved, indicating the presence of an actual question. There are no other question variants or sets mentioned.
Text Length: 261 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_04_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Q.2 Set. (B)", which includes a specific problem to be solved, indicating the presence of an actual question. There are no other question variants or sets mentioned.
Text Length: 261 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_05_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains an actual question, "Q.3 Set. (A)", which is a distinct main question with specific parameters and requirements for the steepest gradient descent method. There is only one question variant present.
Text Length: 310 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_06_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Q.3 Set. (B)", which includes determining the cost function and one iteration of SGD for a specific scenario, with no other distinct main questions or sets present.
Text Length: 310 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_07_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 2
Reason: The content contains two distinct main questions, both labeled as "Q.4 Set. (A)", but with different image pixel points, making them separate questions.
Text Length: 519 chars
Action: Splitting into 2 separate files
Split Result: Failed, keeping original
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_08_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains an actual question (Q.5 Set) with a specific task to determine the model summary and activation function used in the given CNN figure.
Text Length: 166 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_09_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q.5 Set. (B)) with a specific task to determine the model summary and identify the activation function used in the given CNN.
Text Length: 166 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_10_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q.6 Set) with a specific query about GPS, IMU sensors, and accelerometer usage in autonomous vehicles.
Text Length: 150 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_11_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question (Q.6 Set. (B)) with a sub-question asking to differentiate between gyroscope and accelerometer, and there is no indication of multiple sets or question variants.
Text Length: 133 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_12_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Q.7 Set. (A) Explain the diﬀerent steps involved in Kalman ﬁltering.", with no indication of multiple sets or sub-questions.
Text Length: 72 chars
Action: Keep as is
--------------------------------------------------
File: question_13_multipage.pdf
Status: valid
Question Count: 1
Reason: The content contains a single main question, "Diﬀerentiate between linear and logistic regression", which is part of "Q.7 Set. (B)". There are no sub-questions or multiple sets indicated, so it is counted as one distinct main question.
